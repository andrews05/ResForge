/*
 * This filter rewrites the spob DefCount field to use the first 12
 * bits for the total count and the remaining 4 bits for the wave size.
 * The allows a template to interpret it using WB12 and WB04.
 *
 * From the EV Nova Bible, spÃ¶b DefCount: If you set this number
 * to be above 1000, ships will be launched from the planet or
 * station in waves. The last number in this field is the number of
 * ships in each wave, and the first 3-4 numbers (minus 1 from the
 * first digit) are the total number of ships in the planet's
 * fleet. For example, a value of 1082 would be four waves of two
 * ships for a total of eight. A value of 2005 would create waves
 * of five ships each, with 100 ships total in the planet's defense
 * fleet.
